Thanks (and a large amount of credit) to [Andrew Hankinson](https://github.com/ahankinson), [Andrew Fogarty](https://github.com/affogarty), [Evan Magoni](https://github.com/magoni), and the rest of the crew at the [DDMAL](https://github.com/DDMAL) at McGill University for helping with and assembling a lot of this.
